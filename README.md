NEMESIS World - Global macro-economic model

**Overview**

NEMESIS-World is a multi-country, multi-sector, recursive dynamic macroeconomic model, inspired by the EU version of the NEMESIS model. It is a system of interconnected economic models covering 22 world regions, dedicated to studying issues related to economic development, competitiveness, employment, and, in particular, long-term structural policies such as climate policy. The primary purpose of the model is to assess the socioeconomic impacts of various policies through scenario-based comparative analysis. The model's core mechanisms rely on the behaviour of representative agents: firms, households, and governments. On the supply side, the model distinguishes 58 different economic activities that produce goods and services using production functions. These activities employ various production factors: capital, energy, low-, medium-, and high-skilled labour, and other intermediate inputs. All sectors are interlinked through inter-sectoral exchanges (conversion matrices) and international trade. NEMESIS-World also features a detailed energy-environment module, enabling the model to address climate mitigation policies. This module improves the representation of each regionâ€™s energy system by detailing energy use across economic activities and households. In addition, it refines the modelling of the power generation sector by allocating electricity production across different technologies.


**Note of version**

The current corresponds to the economic component of the model. Regarding the energy and climate module, energy and GHG data have already been collected, along with parameters to characterize power generation technologies. Energy data processing has also been completed. The energy and climate module will be integrated in the next release.
**This version is still on development**
